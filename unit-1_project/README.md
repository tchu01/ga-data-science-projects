## Oops!
(message from Vince)

The solutions for projects 1 and 2 were accidentally uploaded and have since been removed. It's not a big deal since we care more about the explanation and walk-through of your code rather than obtaining the correct answer.

**If you cloned the repo that had the solutions**: Remember how your old math textbooks had the answers in back? This isn't much different -- you still have to show your work to get credit. Do your best to solve the coding challenges on your own, and put care into explaining how you solved each problem. 

**If you don't have the solutions**: You can message our IAs and they'll provide all the help you need to arrive at the correct answers (including telling you what the expected outputs are).

Remember, we're here to support you and help you reach your learning goals. Good luck!


## Materials We Provide

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Starter Code | Required questions and Bonus prompts | [Here](./project1.ipynb) |

> Note: Instructors will provide project solutions _after_ students have submitted their drafts.

## Project Objective

We've provided a Jupyter notebook that contains the kinds of coding challenges that often come up in data science job interviews. In addition to preparing you for interviews, completing challenges like these is a fun way to develop your Python skills.

Some of these problems are well known, so it may be possible to find complete solutions online. Students should see these questions as an opportunity to challenge themselves; looking up answers limits the potential growth that comes from practice and repetition of these skills.

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the **required** questions. Your notebook should include:

1. Text for each question, copy and pasted from the starter code provided.
2. A working solution to each problem.
   - Do not include test, practice, or broken code (*unless you were unable to create a working solution*).
3. Comments for all of your code.
   - In your comments, describe any assumptions you made in order to solve these problems.

4. **Optional**: After completing the required portions, try your hand at the **bonus** sections for some additional challenges!

## Rubric

For all projects, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, instructors will provide you with feedback on required portions of your project.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Surpasses our wildest expectations!_

> Note: Scores of `2` mean that a requirement has been completely fulfilled, while `3` is typically reserved for bonus objectives.

## Submission

Create a repository in your github profile, hosting your materials, and then share the link with your instructor. We'll have you do this through a Google Form that will be available shortly.
